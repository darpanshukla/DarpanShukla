# Personal summary
I have multi-disciplinary educational qualifications with experiences in broad areas. I believe in two aspects of human life. One is work. I work with emotions and interest towards problem solving by learning from scratch, and towards generating results with comprehensive considerations and efficiency. I look for job satisfaction, technicality and simplicity. Second is life. I be a good friend with everyone and be simple. Grateful to teachers. My life goals are continuous development and supramental manifestation.

# Professional summary
I have multi-disciplinary educational qualifications with experiences in broad areas. In the past 8 years, my working area (fundamental and applied) has been around reliability, a branch of applied mathematics or more precisely applied probability. Reliability engineering is a multidisciplinary subject and I have extensive experience in my formal assignments to the multiple disciplinary engineered systems - nuclear energy, defense, and human. In chronological order, my reliability applications include digital I&C systems, nuclear power plant safety systems, heat removal systems, electronics equipment of submarine sonar systems, human cognitive reliability, human factors/ergonomics engineering, and presently, microelectronics design and manufacturing. Among these, the most fascinating is my data analytics experience in the fascinating Eye-tracking based plant operator reliability that I experienced during my postdoc at IITM. The second fascinating experience is in nuclear engineering, where I did a most productive project on computational methods for neutron transport modeling and computations, it is this project that I learned that I have an inherent interest in computation and applied probability which in turn has led me to do Ph.D. in the reliability field. Details about my skills, education, and experiences are as follows.
